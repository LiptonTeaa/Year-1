        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>How did you approach the subject? What does your site say about future you?</p>
          <p>I started by looking up different portfolio websites. Some were really amazing, things I was not capabale so, I looked at more doable designs. I looked through alot of different websites and resources to learn how to build my website. I'm not sure what the website says about future me except that i would probably like to work in applicaiton design and development after having looked through various professions during research.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Who is your audience?</p>
        <p>Most probably bigger corporations like google or game studios like bethesda.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Portfolio 1<a href="https://www.mixd.co.uk/"> I liked the sharp simplicity of the homepage.</a> (and thoughts about it)</li>
          <li>Portfolio 2<a href="https://www.samuelday.de/">Just blew my mind(pun intended).</a> (and thoughts about it)</li>
          <li>Portfolio 3<a href="https://www.electricpulp.com/services/">A more realistic approach.</a> (and thoughts about it)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Resource on portfolio creation</p>
          <p>I used these websites to visualize what sort of direction I wanted to head in. Other than some resources for content to add, youtube tutorials were by far the greatest source of information on how to implement ideas.</p>

        <h2>Planning</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Accessibility aspect 1</li>
            <p>I made the nav bar at the very top, where people would first look for it and made sure it's always visable.</p>
          <li>Accessibility aspect 2</li>
            <p>Anything that can be clicked on is highlighted when you hover your cursor over it.</p>
          <li>Accessibility aspect 3</li>
            <p>The website can run on many differt window sizes or devices so, it should be easy to navigae in any form factor.</p>
        </ul>
        <p>How have you made the site easy to navigate?</p>
          <p>I used bright and contrasting colours. Any interactable elements are highlighted. The website should conform to run on multiple devices.</p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>Learning</p>
          <p>I leanred how to build a website from scratch. I learned a lot of new techniqes while trying to implement different designs and how libraries and imports work. As well as chaining different pages together. The biggest thing i learned by far was how long and complex css can get but it is a repeating pattern for almost all elemetnts. I am far more familiar and adept at using different tags, classes, id's and notations.</p>
        <p>Libraries and other resources</p>
          <p>I got my fonts from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google fonts</a>. I used Cuprum and Noto Sans.</p>
          <p>I also used icons from<a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a>. I used a bunch of differnt icons from there, though they were treated like fonts.</p>
          <p>I used a few different websites for the images I used in my website. <a href="https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/693323-abstract-gradient-pink-purple-stripes-on-purple-background">Homepage background...</a><a href="https://meetanentrepreneur.lu/en/most-linkedin-profile/">Picture from about me...</a><a href ="https://www.freevector.com/vector/patterns">Background for the cards in services.</a></p>

        <h2>Evaluation</h2>
        <section>
          <h3>What worked well</h3>
            <p>All the libraries and resources I used worked well. The navbar is also quiet reponsive and porminent. I also managed to have a lot of pages linked to each other.</p>
          <ul>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3>What might be improved</h3>
            <p>It has to be accessibility. It is not very friendly for disabled people. I would definately want to add more accessibility tags and a new colour scheme.</p>
          <ul>
          </ul>

        <h2>References</h2>
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk7xIEmd3MeyhIu2StLX5yA">Coding Nepal</a>
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdxaLo9ALJgXgOUDURRPGiQ">Web Cifar</a>
          <p>Aside from using w3 to reference code, coding nepal and web cifar were youtubers I used. They were a huge help in building my website. Them writing code down and demoing it while they write, you really get to see how every piece works bit by bit. They were a great source to adopt code from.</p>
