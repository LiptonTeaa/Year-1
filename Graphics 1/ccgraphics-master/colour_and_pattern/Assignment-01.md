        -   Activity 1: apply one of your colour palettes to a pattern â€” rows, columns, etc. Experiment with gaps between elements and randomness. Save as **pattern1**
        -   Activity 2: change the pattern shape to something else (rectangles, lines, shapes). Play with scale, rotation, etc. Save as **pattern2**
